This project, a calculator for the web, was created as a final project to demonstrate the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript abilities I acquired while taking The Odin Project's foundations course.

The calculator has the following key features:

    - Add, subtract, multiply and divide operators

    - A 'Clear' button that removes all text on the display

    - A 'Delete' button that removes one character from the aritmetic expression entered into the calculator display

    - A decimal button which allows the user to do arithmetic calculations with decimal numbers

    - Calculator follows order of operation using BODMAS/PEMDAS rules.

    - 3D animations that animates and moves the calculator in 3 dimensions (works best on desktop as 
      it requires cursor to move the calculator around)

    - Fully reponsive UI that scales accordingly for all devices
